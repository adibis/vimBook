#Vim Macros

Macros are one of the best things in VIM for doing repetitive edits. Let's consider an example where you want to get rid of all the file names in the following list. 

```
/path/to/file.ext, required_text1
/paths/to/other/file.ex, required_text2
/this/path/to/file.ext, required_text3
/other/paths/to/other/file.ex, required_text4
/something/else/and/newfile.tx,  required_text5
```
